# plox

plox is a programming language I wrote in Python 3.10, following the first half of [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/). An online demo can be found on [my website](https://www.kevincao.xyz/plox).

Currently, it's unfinished. I'm in the middle of the ninth chapter, and will update this Git repo as I finish other chapters.
